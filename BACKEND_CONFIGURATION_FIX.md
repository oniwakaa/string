# MemOS Backend Configuration Fix Documentation

## Critical Issue Resolved

The system was failing to create project-specific memory cubes due to incorrect backend naming. The error `'persistent_storage' is not a valid backend` was preventing both data ingestion and preference storage.

## Correct MemOS Backend Names

Based on analysis of the MemOS source code (`MemOS/src/memos/memories/factory.py`), the valid backends are:

### 1. Textual Memory (`text_mem`)
- `"naive_text"` - Simple text memory
- `"general_text"` - General text memory with vector DB support (recommended)
- `"tree_text"` - Tree-structured text memory with graph DB support
- `"uninitialized"` - No textual memory

### 2. Activation Memory (`act_mem`)
- `"kv_cache"` - KVCache for LLM computation caching
- `"uninitialized"` - No activation memory (recommended for stability)

### 3. Parametric Memory (`para_mem`)
- `"lora"` - LoRA-based parametric memory (in development)
- `"uninitialized"` - No parametric memory (recommended for stability)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `project_memory_manager.py`

Changed lines 218-237 and 239-274 from complex configurations to simplified:

```python
act_mem={
    "backend": "uninitialized",
    "config": {}
},
para_mem={
    "backend": "uninitialized", 
    "config": {}
}
```

### 2. Fixed MemOS Instance Connection in `run_gguf_service.py`

Changed line 69 from:
```python
if service and hasattr(service, 'mos'):
    project_manager.set_mos_instance(service.mos)
```

To:
```python
if service and hasattr(service, 'mos_instance'):
    project_manager.set_mos_instance(service.mos_instance)
```

Added critical connection at lines 73-76:
```python
# CRITICAL: Set MemOS instance on the service's project memory manager
if hasattr(service, 'project_memory_manager') and service.project_memory_manager:
    service.project_memory_manager.set_mos_instance(service.mos_instance)
    logger.info("ðŸ”— MemOS instance connected to service's ProjectMemoryManager")
```

### 3. Updated Test Files

Fixed `test_parametric_memory_integration.py` lines 85 and 458 to use `"uninitialized"` instead of `"persistent_storage"`.

## Why These Changes Work

1. **Simplified Configuration**: Using `"uninitialized"` for activation and parametric memory removes complexity while maintaining core RAG functionality through textual memory.

2. **Proper MemOS Connection**: The service's project memory manager now receives the MemOS instance, enabling it to create and manage project-specific cubes.

3. **Valid Backend Names**: All backend names now match the MemOS factory registry, preventing validation errors during cube creation.

## Current Architecture

```
Service (gguf_memory_service.py)
â”œâ”€â”€ mos_instance (MemOS)
â”œâ”€â”€ project_memory_manager
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Uses mos_instance for cube operations
â””â”€â”€ ProjectManager (agents/orchestrator.py)
    â””â”€â”€ Also uses mos_instance for agent operations

Memory Configuration:
â”œâ”€â”€ Textual Memory: "general_text" (Active - provides RAG)
â”œâ”€â”€ Activation Memory: "uninitialized" (Simplified)
â””â”€â”€ Parametric Memory: "uninitialized" (Simplified)
```

## Validation

Run the validation script to confirm fixes:
```bash
python validate_service_fixes.py
```

Expected results:
- âœ… Files loaded > 0 (data ingestion working)
- âœ… Preference setting successful
- âœ… Project-specific memory isolation active

## Future Enhancements

Once the system is stable, consider:
1. Implementing `"kv_cache"` for activation memory with proper configuration
2. Waiting for MemOS to release stable `"lora"` backend for parametric memory
3. Using the preference storage pattern (JSON files) as a temporary parametric memory solution
