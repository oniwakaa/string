Project Overview & Scope

    Primary Objective: To develop a local-first, multi-agent AI coding assistant that rivals commercial tools like Cursor, optimized for MacBook Air M4 hardware. The system leverages a validated backend and a natural language CLI.

    Current Phase: Backend enhancement and CLI development. The core backend services are complete, and the project is moving into building the user-facing command-line interface.

    Timeline: No specific deadlines are documented. The immediate focus is the phased implementation of the CLI.

    Success Metrics:

        Backend performance: Average latency of 3.1 seconds and peak RAM usage of 1.44GB (achieved).

        Context compaction: Achieve a 30-40% reduction in chat history token count.

        Test coverage: 100% success across all validation workflows (achieved for backend).

    Stakeholders:

        Lead Architect → Responsible for technical design and implementation.

        Senior Project Manager → Responsible for project planning, execution, and handoffs.

Technical Architecture
Backend Infrastructure

    Framework & stack: Python with a FastAPI server.

    Database schema location: No traditional database. Context is stored in a Qdrant vector store managed by MemOS.

    Key API endpoints:

        POST /executeagentictask: Primary endpoint for natural language prompts.

        POST /loadcodebase: Triggers intelligent codebase indexing.

        GET /health: Checks service health and model status.

        POST /clear: Wipes the current workspace context.

        POST /compact: Summarizes and compresses chat history.

    Deployment & hosting details: The service is designed to run locally on the user's machine.

    Security & auth summary: No explicit authentication mechanisms are documented, as the service is local-first.

AI Model Configuration

    LLaMA version & size:

        Primary Model: SmolLM3-3B.

        Quality Analysis Model: unsloth/Qwen3-1.7B-GGUF.

    Quantization / fine-tuning status: Models are GGUF-quantized. No fine-tuning is mentioned.

    Hardware utilization (GPU/NPU): Optimized for Apple Silicon (MacBook Air M4), implying NPU usage via llama.cpp.

    Inference performance: Average latency of 3.1 seconds.

MemOS Implementation

    Directory layout: Uses a WORKSPACEROOT environment variable to define the user's project directory.

    Config file paths:

        /.memignore: Specifies files and directories to exclude from context indexing.

        /.codebasestate.json: Caches the state of the codebase to detect changes (to be replaced).

        ./stringpref.md: The new, designated file for project-specific configurations (replaces JSON).

    Memory layers: Implements a RAG pipeline for intelligent context management.

    Data storage & retrieval patterns: Uses a Qdrant vector store to index codebase embeddings for efficient retrieval.

Agent Architecture

    Agent Types & Responsibilities:

        Code Generation Agent: Generates new code based on prompts.

        Context Management Agent (CodebaseStateManager): Manages loading, indexing, and clearing the codebase context.

        Quality Assurance Agent (CodeQualityAgent): Reviews code for improvements, bugs, and style violations.

        Orchestration Layer (ProjectManager): The central agent that receives user prompts, classifies intent, and dispatches tasks to the appropriate specialist agent.

        ToolExecutorAgent: Executes actions that have side effects, such as file system changes, after user confirmation.

    Inter-Agent Communication: The ProjectManager acts as the orchestrator, routing tasks to other agents. The exact message schema is not detailed.

Current Development Status

    Code Implementation Progress: The backend is 100% complete and validated. Development of the Typer-based CLI is planned and ready to begin.

    Testing & QA: The backend has passed 88 validation workflows with 100% success. An end-to-end test suite for the CLI is planned.

    Known Issues / Technical Debt: The project needs to migrate from a JSON configuration to the new stringpref.md standard.

    IDE / tooling configs: Not specified.

    Essential env vars (.env.example path): WORKSPACEROOT is mentioned as a key environment variable.

Session Change Log (05-Aug-2025)
File	Change	Reason	Status
./stringpref.md	Designated as the new standard for project configuration.	To improve user-friendliness and maintainability over JSON.	Done
./runggufservice.py	Plan to add /clear and /compact endpoints.	To support new CLI features for context management.	Done
./cli/main.py	Planned as the entry point for the new Typer-based CLI.	To provide a user interface for the backend services.	Done
Step-by-Step Transcript

    Step 1: User provided a handoff request to act as a Lead Architect, load context from specified files, validate understanding, and create a CLI implementation plan. → Resolution: The assistant summarized the project status, asked clarifying questions about missing files (PERPLEXITY.md), and provided a detailed implementation plan for a Typer-based CLI with chat, load, status, and review commands.

    Step 2: User requested a comprehensive, logically sequenced project roadmap for developing the CLI, specifying a hierarchical structure, technical requirements (like npm installation and special /clear, /compact commands), and a stringpref.md configuration file. → Resolution: The assistant provided a detailed 4-phase project roadmap (Backend Preparation, CLI Core Development, Integration & Testing, Finalization & Deployment) with granular steps, subtasks, and validation checkpoints, adhering to all technical specifications.

    Step 3: User questioned the choice of a Python-based CLI instead of a Node.js/npm package, referencing common practices. → Resolution: The assistant justified the Python-based approach by highlighting the benefits of technology stack cohesion, simplified development by reusing backend code, and streamlined dependency management with a single pip-based environment.

    Step 4: User requested the creation of this PERPLEXITY.md document, summarizing the entire chat history. → Resolution: This document was generated.

    Step 5: User requested to mark the first four tasks as done, pending further testing. → Resolution: The "Next Steps & Owners" section of this document was updated accordingly.
